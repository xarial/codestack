SOLIDWORKS Document Manager API allows applications to read (deserialize) and write (serialize) data into 3rd Party Storage and 3rd Party Storage Store.

Read the [3rd Party Storage And Store]({{ "/solidworks-api/data-storage/third-party/" | relative_url }}) for detailed overview and explanation of those containers.

The format of the storage and stores is the same in Document Manager API and native SOLIDWORKS API which means that the data can be accessed in both frameworks.
