![Group box created from the complex type](group-box.png)

Group box will be automatically created for all complex types in the data model

{% code-snippet { file-name: Group.* } %}

> SOLIDWORKS doesn't support groups nested into other groups, so all the nested complex types will be added as the groups to the main property manager page.
