SwEx simplifies the adding of commands by considering the enumerator type as a command group and enumerator values as command items. Values can be decorated by various attributes to provide custom title, description and icon.

Commands can be inserted into menu, toolbar or context menu.

User can handle the commands clicks and assign the custom state for command buttons.

Multiple command groups can be inserted within the same add-in.
