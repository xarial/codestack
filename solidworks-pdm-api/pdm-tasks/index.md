SOLIDWORKS PDM task is a special type of add-ins which enables additional functionality:

* Task can be configured to automatically trigger on a workflow
* Task can be executed on the dedicated remote machine

Task can be created from scratch using SOLIDWORKS PDM API.

There are several built-in tasks available out-of-the-box such as Print and Convert tasks. Script behind those tasks can be customized using SOLIDWORKS PDM API.
