This section describes ways to perform inter-process communication between applications developed for SOLIDWORKS. Communication involves passing of custom parameters or signals between different modules (i.e. macros, add-ins and stand-alone applications).

This could allows to introduce additional level of automation for the applications developed for SOLIDWORKS. As an example the following techniques can be used for the inter-process communication: COM, named pipes, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), shared memory, buffer, file exchange etc.

Explore this section for detailed guides and examples for establishing the communication between software developed for SOLIDWORKS.
